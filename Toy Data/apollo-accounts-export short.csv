AiM Medical Robotics,http://www.aimmedicalrobotics.com,"AiM Medical Robotics is a neurosurgical robotics company that is working to bring high levels of precision, automation, and efficiency to the surgical suite by introducing portable MRI-functional robotics into the complex surgical environment of neurosurgery. We are developing a portable neurosurgical robot for use in the MRI scanner. Our mission is to improve outcomes for patients undergoing neurosurgery for functional brain disorders (Parkinson's, Epilepsy, etc.) and Glioblastoma while providing cost savings to hospitals by eliminating error and reducing procedure time by up to 50%.",,,,
"Brain Technologies, Inc.",http://www.brain.ai,"At Brain.ai, we build computers that think. We invent new technologies and design metaphors that allow computers to become an extension of our minds instead of simply our hands. As we transition from the information age to the intelligence age, we bridge the existing world of software with emerging general intelligence in a natural and humane way.",,,,

Whole Brain Health Initiative,http://www.wholebrainhealth.org,"Our vision is a world in which people are making the best of their brains in the most fun way. This occurs after several fundamental shifts are made in the way people approach self-improvement. Instead of aimlessly following the fad of the month, people are reflecting on their own individual lifestyles and deciphering what changes would serve their own individual brain the best. Secondly, people utilize behavioral change sciences to implement the changes in a sustainable manner.  Lastly, people are monitoring their brain performance in a way where they know they are making the best of their brain.

In this world where people are making the best of their brains, the incidences of Dementia are significantly reduced, people recovering from Traumatic Brain Injuries are guided to the quickest and best recovery possible, people at the workplace are performing more effectively, children perform better in school, and anyone else who wants to improve upon their brain is enabled to successfully do so.

Our services and resources are all aligned to actualize this vision.  Both individualized and group health coaching programs, corporate brain health challenges, and our signature 'Dance To Remember'​ event all guide people through improving their brain's health and performance with natural and sustainable measures.",,,,
BrainSpace,http://www.brainspacemed.com,"BrainSpace is building automated, connected devices that protect the brain and help it heal. By automating nursing workflows, we aim to improve patient safety, reduce long-term brain damage, relieve ICU staff burnout, free up ICU beds, generate AI-ready datasets, and democratize access to care. Our razor/razorblade model delivers high margin recurring revenue and overall reduced cost. Our first product delivers wearable continuous pressure monitoring (ICP) and precision CSF drainage treatment.

We start by replacing the manual, labor intensive EVD and ICP monitor with an integrated, automated CSF management system. Our device facilitates patient mobility and is capable of controlling minimally invasive CSF drainage with single drop precision and sensing at 100 samples a second rather than 1 per hour. 

By generating AI-ready datasets annotated at the source, we are expediting the clinical evaluation of digital biomarkers and machine learning driven treatment algorithms. Our unique access to brain fluid and novel data will allow us to support a wider range of neuro research.

The brain is the one organ we can't transplant. 5 million Americans are living with a disability related to a traumatic brain injury and another 2 million Americans are living with a reversible form of dementia called NPH. Excess pressure on the brain can be a threat at any age: infants with congenital hydrocephalus or post-partum hemorrhage, youth and adults with traumatic brain injury, and aging adults with stroke or dementia.

If you'd like to join us in building the future of neuro care, we'd love to hear from you.
