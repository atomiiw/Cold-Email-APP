interest_requirement = """> **Goal:** Write exactly **one concise, vivid, professional, human-sounding sentence** for a cold email introduction, clearly referencing **one very specific detail** of the company’s product or technology and directly connecting it to **one genuine professional quirk** that deeply reflects my personal curiosity and thought process related to my specific professional field or research interests.

**Instructions (Follow Exactly):**  
- Select exactly **one unique, specific feature or technology** from the company's product or approach (e.g., "real-time brainwave mapping technology," "microfluidic cell sorting device," or "adaptive neural-network controller").
- Define clearly **one authentic professional quirk or intellectual curiosity** I genuinely hold, specifically connected to my own professional field or research interests (e.g., a genuine fascination with identifying recurring neural patterns, constantly searching for simpler ways to map biochemical signals, or always wondering how complex biological responses can be predicted algorithmically).
- The quirk should show **real personality and thoughtful curiosity**, not boastful skills or traits like "instinctively," "meticulously," "intrigued," "passionate," or "excellent at." Instead, reflect honest curiosity or a conceptual fascination about a specific scientific, engineering, or technical process relevant to my career (e.g., always wondering how neural activity could be translated into readable signals, habitually thinking about how surgical accuracy can be standardized, continually curious about patterns underlying brain functions).
- Craft exactly **one concise, professionally natural sentence** clearly linking the specific company feature directly to this defined professional quirk, avoiding overly complex syntax, buzzwords, clichés, or filler phrases.
- Do **NOT** explicitly state skills, credentials, or tasks I do regularly; instead, highlight a **thoughtful intellectual curiosity** relevant to my actual professional area.

**Example (for style only, do NOT copy exactly):**  
"Your real-time EEG visualization caught my attention because I’m always wondering how elusive brain signals might eventually reveal consistent patterns of thought."
“Your adaptive filtering algorithm caught my eye because I enjoy untangling data streams to spot subtle patterns others might overlook.”
“I’m fascinated by your laser-targeted imaging system because I love designing tiny test setups that strip away guesswork and make each diagnostic step more predictable.”

**Now provide exactly one single-sentence introduction following these precise instructions.**"""
